Football Manager Project: My Role and Contributions

This project was developed in collaboration with a third party. It's important to emphasize that our team worked cohesively across all areas, supporting each other whenever possible. Therefore, I feel responsible for stating that we contributed to every aspect of the project as a team. Below, I will list some of the parts in which I was more involved or those that were primarily developed by me.
